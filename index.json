I am particularly interested in isotope geochemistry and using computational techniques to analyse large datasets both temporally and spatially.\nI am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with Laurentian University and the Geological Survey of Canada. I am working on a global compilation of isotope data (primarily Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd) to unravel the secular changes in mineral deposits and tectonics throughout Earthâ€™s history.\nI completed my PhD at the University of Adelaide, Australia 2019. I primarily used isotope geochemistry, structural geology and statistical/computational techniques to construct models for the tectonic evolution of Madagascar and India during the Precambrian. My research involved integrating large datasets of isotopic data to develop plate reconstructions for Madagascar from the Archean to early Cambrian.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","section":"authors","summary":"My research focuses on the links between plate tectonics, supercontinent cycles and mineral systems, and the cyclical and secular changes of these through time.

In response to the global COVID-19 crisis and the reduced connectivity among colleagues, I have organised a weekly Virtual Seminar Series hosted on zoom for the tectonics/geodynamics community. We hear from a diverse range of scientists researching many aspects relating to plate tectonics and geodynamics. Importantly, we are able to share science with a whole range of people from different parts of the world, many of who would not normally be able to attend in person conferences and seminars.\nCheck out the IGCP 648 Virtual Seminar Series website for more information and to see past seminar recordings:\n","date":1594425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594425600,"objectID":"8d85f824e052e4cb28ec4a3e9ad08d6b","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/post/igcp648post/","publishdate":"2020-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/igcp648post/","section":"post","summary":"The IGCP 648 (Supercontinent Cycles and Global Geodynamics) is a collaborative project involving researchers from all around the world.
