I primarily use isotope geochemistry, statistical programming, GIS and plate reconstructions in my research.\nAs of 2022, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tasmania in Australia. I am investigating the temporal controls on mineralisation in western Tasmania, on a collaborative project funded by Geoscience Australia. This has important implications for understanding the development of critical minerals in Tasmania, and for constraining the tectonic and metallogenic evolution of this region.\nBetween 2019 and 2021 I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Geological Survey of Canada and Laurentian University in Ottawa, Canada. I used a global compilation of isotope data (primarily Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd) to unravel the secular changes in mineral deposits and tectonics throughout Earth‚Äôs history. This research investigates the relationship between the Pb isotopic evolution of terranes and their metal endowment, with a focus on the Superior Province in Canada. This project is a collaboration between researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, the Geological Survey of Canada and Geoscience Australia.\nI completed my PhD at the University of Adelaide (Australia) in 2019. I used isotope geochemistry, structural geology and statistical/computational techniques to construct models for the tectonic evolution of Madagascar and India during the Precambrian. My research involved integrating large datasets of isotopic data to understand the tectonic evolution of Madagascar from the Archean to early Cambrian. This research contributes to broader aims of reconstructing tectonic plates of the entire Earth from the Neoproterozoic to present using GPlates.\nI worked as a geochronologist/mineral systems geologist at Geoscience Australia from 2014 to 2015, where I worked on the geochronology and geochemistry of the Tasmanides in Eastern Australia. I completed my honours at Monash University in 2013, where I used geophysics, drillcore data and 3D modelling to interpret the structural evolution of a Cu-Au deposit in South Australia.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a geoscientist interested in the links between plate tectonics and ore deposits, and the cyclical and secular changes of these through time.

Check out the EarthArXiv Preprint here and the shiny web app here\nAbstract: The package PbIso is a free and open R toolbox for commonly used calculations and plots of Pb-Pb isotope data. In this paper, we review Pb isotope systematics and the calculations that are commonly used, such as model age, model source ùúá (238U/204Pb), time-integrated ùúÖ (232Th/238U), and initial Pb isotope ratios. These complicated equations are implemented into simple R functions in the package PbIso. In addition, functions are provided for generating model curves, geochron lines, and time-dependent slopes. This allows users to apply calculations to their data in a straightforward way, while providing transparency and flexibility of the calculations used. We have implemented some basic features of the PbIso package into an online shiny application (https://shereearmistead.shinyapps.io/PbIsoApp/), which makes it easy for users without any R experience to use these calculations with their own data and to generate plots.\nCitation: Armistead, S.E., Eglington, B.M. and Pehrsson, S.J., 2021. ‚ÄúPbIso: an R package and web app for calculating and plotting Pb isotope data.‚Äù EarthArXiv.

Check out the EarthArXiv Preprint here\nAbstract: The Adelaide Rift Complex in South Australia records the break-up of Rodinia at a time of great climatic and biological evolution. The Boucaut Volcanics within the Neoproterozoic Adelaide Rift Complex lie at the base of the Burra Group, marking the boundary between the Burra Group and underlying Callanna Group. Despite their significance as one of the few volcanic units within the rift complex, there has been no robust age determination published for the Boucaut Volcanics. We use U‚ÄìPb zircon LA-ICP-MS data to determine an age of 788 ¬± 6 Ma for the eruption of the bimodal Boucaut Volcanics. This has important implications for constraining the timing of stratigraphy within the Adelaide Rift Complex. This also has far reaching implications for plate tectonic reconstructions of Australia and Laurentia, and for correlating global isotope anomalies for the Neoproterozoic.\nCitation: Armistead, Sheree E., Alan Collins, Solomon Buckman, and Rachel Atkins. 2020. ‚ÄúAge and Geochemistry of the Boucaut Volcanics in the Neoproterozoic Adelaide Rift Complex, South Australia.‚Äù EarthArXiv.
