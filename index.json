I primarily use isotope geochemistry, statistical programming, GIS and plate reconstruction software in my research.\nI am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Geological Survey of Canada and Laurentian University, in Ottawa, Canada (currently based at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia as an Adjunct Researcher due to the COVID-19 situation in Canada). I am working on a global compilation of isotope data (primarily Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd) to unravel the secular changes in mineral deposits and tectonics throughout Earth’s history. This work aims to understand the relationship between the Pb isotopic evolution of terranes and their mineral endowment, with a focus on the Superior Province in Canada.\nI completed my PhD at the University of Adelaide (Australia) in 2019. I primarily used isotope geochemistry, structural geology and statistical/computational techniques to construct models for the tectonic evolution of Madagascar and India during the Precambrian. My research involved integrating large datasets of isotopic data to understand the tectonic evolution of Madagascar from the Archean to early Cambrian. This research contributes to broader aims of reconstructing tectonic plates of the entire Earth from the Neoproterozoic to present using GPlates. I have collaborated with members of the EarthByte Group at the University of Sydney who are working towards these reconstructions.\nI worked as a geochronologist/mineral systems geologist at Geoscience Australia from 2014 to 2015, where I worked on the geochronology and geochemistry of the Tasmanides in Eastern Australia. I completed my honours at Monash University in 2013, where I used geophysics, drillcore data and 3D modelling to interpret the structural evolution of a Cu-Au deposit in South Australia.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a geoscientist interested in the links between plate tectonics, supercontinent cycles and mineral systems, and the cyclical and secular changes of these through time.

Check out the EarthArXiv Preprint here\nAbstract: The Adelaide Rift Complex in South Australia records the break-up of Rodinia at a time of great climatic and biological evolution. The Boucaut Volcanics within the Neoproterozoic Adelaide Rift Complex lie at the base of the Burra Group, marking the boundary between the Burra Group and underlying Callanna Group. Despite their significance as one of the few volcanic units within the rift complex, there has been no robust age determination published for the Boucaut Volcanics. We use U–Pb zircon LA-ICP-MS data to determine an age of 788 ± 6 Ma for the eruption of the bimodal Boucaut Volcanics. This has important implications for constraining the timing of stratigraphy within the Adelaide Rift Complex. This also has far reaching implications for plate tectonic reconstructions of Australia and Laurentia, and for correlating global isotope anomalies for the Neoproterozoic.\nCitation: Armistead, Sheree E., Alan Collins, Solomon Buckman, and Rachel Atkins. 2020. “Age and Geochemistry of the Boucaut Volcanics in the Neoproterozoic Adelaide Rift Complex, South Australia.” EarthArXiv.
