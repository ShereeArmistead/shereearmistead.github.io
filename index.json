My expertise spans isotope geochemistry, data science, GIS, and plate reconstruction techniques to unravel the processes that shape mineral systems over geological timescales.\nMy DECRA fellowship on \u0026lsquo;the interplay of tectonics and climate on critical minerals in deep time\u0026rsquo; seeks to address the urgent need for critical minerals by identifying tectonic and climatic conditions favorable for forming sediment-hosted copper and cobalt deposits over the last billion years. Using samples from the Central African Copperbelt—the world’s largest sediment-hosted Cu-Co district—alongside cutting-edge plate tectonic models, global sedimentary basin datasets, and geochemical tools, this research aims to provide innovative predictive frameworks for locating ore deposits in Australia and globally.\nI joined UTAS as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer in 2022, where I have led and contributed to several research projects, including a collaborative project with Geoscience Australia on the tectonic and metallogenic evolution of western Tasmania. My work bridges the gap between fundamental geoscience research and its practical applications in mineral exploration.\nBefore joining UTAS, I undertook a two-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa, funded through the Metal Earth program at Laurentian University. This project used a global database of Pb isotopes from ore deposits to understand early Earth geodynamics and plate tectonics, with implications for ore-forming regions, particularly the Superior Province in Canada.\nI completed my PhD at the University of Adelaide in 2019, focusing on the tectonic evolution of supercontinent Gondwana, with a specific emphasis on Madagascar. My research used isotope geochemistry, structural geology, and geodata analytics to constrain the paleogeography of Madagascar and neighboring regions throughout several supercontinent cycles. This work contributed to refining global plate reconstructions spanning the past billion years.\nPrior to my PhD, I worked at Geoscience Australia as a Geochronologist and Mineral Systems Geologist after earning a BSc (Honours) from Monash University.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an Australian Research Council DECRA Research Fellow at CODES (Centre for Ore Deposit and Earth Sciences) at the University of Tasmania, where I investigates the interplay between plate tectonics and mineral systems, focusing on their cyclical and long-term changes throughout Earth’s history.","tags":null,"title":"Dr Sheree Armistead","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project overview The exact timing of mineralisation and ore deposits formation are difficult to constrain accurately, as these deposits tend to be affected by multiple episodes of deformation and crystallisation.

Check UTAS and MRT sample inventories to see if samples are available for the Strickland Deposit, which has a very similar Mesoproterozoic Pb isotope model age to Interview River. Collect a zircon U-Pb age for the Interview granite (double check that one doesn’t exist) Date minerals such as monazite to constrain age of mineralisation If the monazite dating confirms a Mesoproterozoic age then this is a major finding for Tasmania. A manuscript on this would then require a thorough review of the geology and tectonic evolution of Tasmania.   Darwin South  This is a deposit on Mount Darwin south of Queenstown. There has been phosphates identified, small but datable.   Henty  Good communication with Henty Gold Mine who plan on sending us more samples to date. Access to further samples if required should be straightforward. Phosphates have been identified. This may require a bit more work, but should be doable.   Savage River  Monazite date exists (~500 Ma), however many interpret this as Devonian. Need further age constraints.   Mt Lyell  Very complicated paragenesis, so dating will be challenging There are phosphates around, and there are some moly ages around - ~500 Ma and 492 Ma. The question is if there are multiple pulses of mineralisation. This may mean getting additional samples, either by visiting the mine or raiding the UTas collection (there should be material David Huston and Ollie Raymond collected). This could require the most effort.
