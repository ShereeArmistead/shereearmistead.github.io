I primarily use isotope geochemistry, statistical programming, GIS and plate reconstructions in my research.\nAs of 2022, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tasmania in Australia. I am investigating the temporal controls on mineralisation in western Tasmania, on a collaborative project funded by Geoscience Australia. This has important implications for understanding the development of critical minerals in Tasmania, and for constraining the tectonic and metallogenic evolution of this region.\nBetween 2019 and 2021 I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Geological Survey of Canada and Laurentian University in Ottawa, Canada. I used a global compilation of isotope data (primarily Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd) to unravel the secular changes in mineral deposits and tectonics throughout Earth‚Äôs history. This research investigates the relationship between the Pb isotopic evolution of terranes and their metal endowment, with a focus on the Superior Province in Canada. This project is a collaboration between researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, the Geological Survey of Canada and Geoscience Australia.\nI completed my PhD at the University of Adelaide (Australia) in 2019. I used isotope geochemistry, structural geology and statistical/computational techniques to construct models for the tectonic evolution of Madagascar and India during the Precambrian. My research involved integrating large datasets of isotopic data to understand the tectonic evolution of Madagascar from the Archean to early Cambrian. This research contributes to broader aims of reconstructing tectonic plates of the entire Earth from the Neoproterozoic to present using GPlates.\nI worked as a geochronologist/mineral systems geologist at Geoscience Australia from 2014 to 2015, where I worked on the geochronology and geochemistry of the Tasmanides in Eastern Australia. I completed my honours at Monash University in 2013, where I used geophysics, drillcore data and 3D modelling to interpret the structural evolution of a Cu-Au deposit in South Australia.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shereearmistead.github.io/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr-sheree-armistead/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a geoscientist interested in the links between plate tectonics and ore deposits, and the cyclical and secular changes of these through time.

Check UTAS and MRT sample inventories to see if samples are available for the Strickland Deposit, which has a very similar Mesoproterozoic Pb isotope model age to Interview River. Collect a zircon U-Pb age for the Interview granite (double check that one doesn‚Äôt exist) Date minerals such as monazite to constrain age of mineralisation If the monazite dating confirms a Mesoproterozoic age then this is a major finding for Tasmania. A manuscript on this would then require a thorough review of the geology and tectonic evolution of Tasmania.   Darwin South  This is a deposit on Mount Darwin south of Queenstown. There has been phosphates identified, small but datable.   Henty  Good communication with Henty Gold Mine who plan on sending us more samples to date. Access to further samples if required should be straightforward. Phosphates have been identified. This may require a bit more work, but should be doable.   Savage River  Monazite date exists (~500 Ma), however many interpret this as Devonian. Need further age constraints.   Mt Lyell  Very complicated paragenesis, so dating will be challenging There are phosphates around, and there are some moly ages around - ~500 Ma and 492 Ma. The question is if there are multiple pulses of mineralisation. This may mean getting additional samples, either by visiting the mine or raiding the UTas collection (there should be material David Huston and Ollie Raymond collected).

In this paper, we review Pb isotope systematics and the calculations that are commonly used, such as model age, model source ùúá (238U/204Pb), time-integrated ùúÖ (232Th/238U), and initial Pb isotope ratios. These complicated equations are implemented into simple R functions in the package PbIso. In addition, functions are provided for generating model curves, geochron lines, and time-dependent slopes. This allows users to apply calculations to their data in a straightforward way, while providing transparency and flexibility of the calculations used. We have implemented some basic features of the PbIso package into an online shiny application (https://shereearmistead.shinyapps.io/PbIsoApp/), which makes it easy for users without any R experience to use these calculations with their own data and to generate plots.\nCitation: Armistead, S.E., Eglington, B.M. and Pehrsson, S.J., 2021. ‚ÄúPbIso: an R package and web app for calculating and plotting Pb isotope data.‚Äù EarthArXiv.

The Boucaut Volcanics within the Neoproterozoic Adelaide Rift Complex lie at the base of the Burra Group, marking the boundary between the Burra Group and underlying Callanna Group. Despite their significance as one of the few volcanic units within the rift complex, there has been no robust age determination published for the Boucaut Volcanics. We use U‚ÄìPb zircon LA-ICP-MS data to determine an age of 788 ¬± 6 Ma for the eruption of the bimodal Boucaut Volcanics.
